# Ally
A C++ web framework, built on top op [Crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow).

Ally aims to build a more complete web framework on top of the Crow microframework.

## Please note
This is a hobby project and my very first open source project. I am not a seasoned C++ developer, so any feedback on the project's structure or code is more than welcome!

## Requirements/sources
Ally wouldn't be here without some awesome libraries:
* [Crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow)
* [Mstch](https://github.com/no1msd/mstch)
* [C++ MySQL Connector](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-cpp)
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
